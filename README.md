## Introduction
Use them in your game development software to easily switch between day and night or have every world or level have a slightly different style than the last one.

## How color maps improve your game
Create themes like *forest*, *desert*, *retro* or change the atmosphere of the game. Let the stage appear frozen in seconds, increase the red colors for the final boss fight,
take away the saturation and add touch light blue and all the sudden your grassland area could now be set in heaven. Quickly move a green forst into the early or even late
autumn season or go really crazy and shft the hue with these color maps, invert the color in multiple different ways or use one of the black/white effects.

Think faster: Color Maps can also be used for frames of glitching effects, transitions between rooms/scenes, teleportations of the player or to emphasize dealting or
taking damage etc..

**The possibilities are endless.**
